  <h1>How 2 Graduate BCS</h1>
  <h1>Wonder what courses you still need to take?</h1>
  <p>This website gives you information about the leftover requirements you need to fulfill in order to get your degree.
  </p>
  <p style="color:red; font-weight: bold; font-size:20px">Currently, you must meet these conditions in order for the
    analyzer to work:</p>
  <p style="color:red;">- You are a 2025 or 2026 University of Waterloo Bachelor of Computer Science (Co-op) undergrad
    student following <a
      href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/sites/ca.computer-science/files/uploads/files/2021-2022_bcs_3.pdf">this
      checklist.</a></p>
  <p style="color:red;">- You have not passed multiple (> 1) courses that are prerequisites of another CS course that
    has already been passed.</p>
  <p style="color:red;">- You did not pass multiple different courses with the same number (ex. ENGL 108B and ENGL
    108D).</p>
  <p style="color:red;">- You did not discuss any exceptions with your CS advisor.</p>
  <p style="color:red;">- You only took courses worth 0.5 units, or credit/non-credit courses.</p>
  <p style="color:red;">- You did your Depth constraint with a 300 level course (so either option A, or option B with a
    300 level course).</p>
  <p style="color:red;">
    Note that the analyzer follows a heuristic of how students complete their checklist; it's not a definite algorithm,
    because there can exist multiple checkboxes that can be satisfied by one course (students can choose which checkbox
    to satisfy). Due to the unofficial transcript not including courses satisfied by AP/IB credits, you will have to
    take those courses into consideration after analyzing. Finally, the analyzer may contain bugs and/or errors, so
    don't take this too seriously; the <a
      href=http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/group/MATH-Computer-Science-1>University Calendar</a> always takes
    precedence.</p>
